Chat bot project

We have utilized IBM Watson Assistant to create our very own chatbot for the Auto Nation challenge. This chatbot specializes in customer representative skills and intakes all of the clients' input to give store hours, location, information on existing orders, and appointments. 

You can access the chat bot through this link: https://web-chat.global.assistant.watson.cloud.ibm.com/preview.html?region=us-south&integrationID=e38eb285-1965-40d0-a418-4ca5e9ea271e&serviceInstanceID=bb3cfb8f-3601-4bda-a373-34b1e88219c1
